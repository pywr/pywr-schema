<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[Pywr](https://github.com/pywr/pywr) is a water resources modelling library. It uses a JSON file
format for model definition. Unfortunately it contains no strong schema definition and uses 
bespoke deserialization methods. This makes parsing model definitions in other tools difficult.

Several attempts have been made to add and strengthen the schema definition in Pywr itself, but
these have become difficult to implement due to backward compatibility reasons. Therefore, this
project has been created as a separate definition of the Pywr JSON schema. It is implemented in
Rust using `serde` and `serde_json`. It aims to achieve schema compatibility with the latest
version of Pywr while also supporting custom nodes and parameters. 

The package is split into a library, `pywr_schema`, and validator `pywr_validator`. Other tools
may make use of the library for parsing Pywr JSON.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Pywr-schema is built with Rust and requires a working
[installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). To validate a Pywr JSON file run the
`pywr_validator` as follows. 


   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pywr/pywr-schema.git
   cd pywr-schema
   cargo r --bin pywr_validator -- --path /path/to/my-model.json
   ```
